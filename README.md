# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Clustering with KMeans and PCA

## Workflow Summary  

### 1.Data Exploration  
- View column summaries and data types  
- Identify key behavioral features  
- Visualize distributions and relationships  

### 2.Data Cleaning  
- Handle missing values 
- Detect outliers and skewness  
- Prepare data for modeling  

### 3.Pre-Clustering Analysis  
- Scale numerical features  
- Optionally apply PCA for dimensionality reduction  

### 4.Modeling  
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)  
- Choose optimal number of clusters  
- Assign cluster labels and visualize separation  

### 5.Post-Clustering Analysis  
- Visualize feature distributions per cluster  
- Analyze behavioral patterns  
- Build charts and summaries for storytelling
